# 5-1: Capstone/Next Steps

Congratulations on making it to the end of this introduction to Python! We've covered a lot of territory over these sessions, and it's absolutely okay to feel a little overwhelmed by it. As always, take the time to slow down, break things into smaller pieces, and put the small pieces together until the big thing works.

## Capstone Rubric

To "complete" this course, we're asking you to build something of your own. And because it's something of your own, _you_ will have to be the one that assesses it. But don't worryâ€”we've created this handy rubric to help you evaluate your work.

**Criterion** | **1 - Fair** | **2 - Good** | **3 - Outstanding**
--|--|--|--
**Research** | I glanced at the documentation. | I referred to the documentation throughout my project. | I learned something new by reading the documentation.
**Functionality** | My project works mostly as intended. | My project works as intended. | My project works, and I was able to add extra features.
**Core skills** | I was able to use most of the 5 Elements of programming. | I was able to use all 5 Elements of Programming. | I was able to use all 5 Elements, and put them together in useful ways.
**TLAP** | I broke big problems down. | I planned my project before writing code. | I considered usage and data types in my plan. 
**Growth** | I used mostly what we covered in this course. | I learned something new while making this project. | I learned something new that was outside my comfort zone.

This course is yours, so please continue to work until you've completed your project to _your_ satisfaction. And as always, remember that there is a community of people willing to help you out!

Good luck on the next steps in your programming journey.
